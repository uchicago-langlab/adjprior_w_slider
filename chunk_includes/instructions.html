    <b>Instructions</b><br>

    <p>
    In this experiment, you will be shown an array of five images on the screen. Your task is to indicate <b>for each object how likely you think it is</b>. You will give your rating by moving a slider bar on a scale from 0 to 100. A rating of 0 means you think the object is 'very unlikely', and a rating of 100 means you think it is 'very likely'. You can choose any value in between by moving the bar on the slider.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    When you complete one array, hit 'continue', and you will see another array. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There are 48 items total, and a brief questionnaire at the end. You should be able to finish in about 10-15 minutes total.
    </p>
    
   <p>
   To ensure that you can see all the images on the screen, please maximize your browser screen now, and close any other open windows.
  </p>

    <b>Instructions</b><br>

    In this experiment, you will see arrays of five images on the screen. Above the images will be a description. For each array: look at all of the images, decide which one you think is the most likely in the world, and select it using the checkbox below each image. You can only select one image. After making the selection, you will be asked to explain how you make the judgment. Then hit 'continue', and you will see another array. 

    There are 48 items total, and a brief questionnaire at the end. You should be able to finish in about 10-15 minutes total.
    
    Before you begin the experiment, there will be two practice items.

<p><b><u>Purpose of the research:</u></b> To examine how people produce and comprehend language.</p>

<p><b><u>Time required:</u></b> Participation will last approximately 15 minutes.</p>

<p><b><u>Risks:</u></b> There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from reading a newspaper or viewing a computer monitor for 20 minutes and using a mouse or keyboard, and listening to someoneâ€™s voice at a normal speaking volume.</p>
